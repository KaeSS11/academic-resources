# Copy this file to .env.local and change the password if you want
# Default password is 'admin123' if not set

# IMPORTANT: This is ONLY used for local development (npm run dev)
# In production, the site is read-only - you can't create projects or upload files
# through the website. You must edit data/projects.json and data/files.json manually.

ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123

# Note: No environment variables are needed for production deployment!
# The project uses static file storage (data/ and public/uploads/)
# which are committed to git and work automatically when deployed.
