There is no accessible German course as promised there is no purpose of studying languages at all because it doesn't give any single paper. All the administrative questions are being ignored for three months and sometimes even more and then managers dare to throw me a reply that I didn't reach out to them on time, which is outrageous. Only good thing is a perfectly polite manager at the examination office. Another aspect is gear for advertising program. There is no proper sources. For instance, there is no AI access at all. All the illustrators, and photographers: they have proper gear. Meanwhile, advertisers are forced to create content out of nothing and they have no services at all. Another topic is library: writing scientific papers or academic outlines or researches. There is no sources at all. University doesn't provide any sources to scientific papers to documents to different portals. For instance statista premium access, business papers, analytical sources, etc, and the university does not pay for any of them even if you ask that you need it. the only saving boat for this university is my professor of advertising. Other than that that would be a completely horrible experience. He's not just covers for all university and all the teachers, but he also covers a lot of administrative questions and he helps as much as he can otherwise that the administration is horrible and I would give it zero out of 10.","2","2","2","1","1","2","2","5","4","1","4","4","3","4","5","3","3","1","2","2","3","51","28","33","30","25","34","448","185",,"2026-01-19 16:06:13","complete","1","0","7","7","0","0","0.61",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
